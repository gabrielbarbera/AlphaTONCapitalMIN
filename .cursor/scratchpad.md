## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES - RESOLVED ✅

### 1. ✅ **EXTERNAL CDN DEPENDENCY - FIXED**

**Issue:** `index.html` line 13 was using external CDN

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Solution Applied:**
1. Downloaded Chart.js 4.4.0 UMD bundle
2. Placed in `assets/js/chart.min.js` (205KB)
3. Updated `index.html` to reference local file:
   ```html
   <script src="assets/js/chart.min.js"></script>
   ```

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` - Updated script src to local path
- `assets/js/chart.min.js` - Added local Chart.js library

**Verification:**
- Chart.js now hosted locally ✅
- No external CDN dependencies ✅
- Stock chart functionality preserved ✅

---

## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES

### 1. ⚠️ Empty Alt Text on Decorative Images
- **83 instances** of `alt=""` across HTML files
- These appear to be decorative icons that should have empty alt text (correct for decorative images)
- **Status:** Acceptable per WCAG guidelines (decorative elements should have empty alt)

### 2. ℹ️ Forms Use Client-Side Only
- Contact form and newsletter forms only show success messages
- Not connected to server-side handler (as required by Notified)
- **Status:** Acceptable - Forms are static as per Notified requirements

### 3. ℹ️ Stock Chart Uses External Library
- Uses Chart.js for stock visualization
- This is the same library causing the CDN issue above
- **Recommendation:** Either host locally or replace with static chart
